"""
Ranking Algorithms for Food Waste Reduction Platform

This module contains different store ranking algorithms that determine
which stores are displayed to customers. The goal is to optimize for:
- Minimizing food waste (unsold bags)
- Maximizing revenue
- Fair distribution of exposure across stores

Each algorithm has the same signature:
    func(stores_df, n, current_bags) -> list[store_id]

Where:
    - stores_df: DataFrame with store information
    - n: Number of stores to return (display to customer)
    - current_bags: Dict mapping store_id -> remaining bags

Algorithm Design Techniques (allowed per course):
1. Greedy - Make locally optimal choices
2. Divide and Conquer - Break problem into subproblems
3. Transform and Conquer - Change data representation
4. Dynamic Programming - Optimal substructure + overlapping subproblems
5. Backtracking - Build solution incrementally

NOTE: Brute force is NOT allowed in this course.

    BASELINE ALGORITHM: Greedy by Rating

    Strategy: Always show the highest-rated stores that have bags available.
    This is the current system's approach.

    Pros:
    - Simple to implement
    - Shows "best" stores to customers

    Cons:
    - Popular stores sell out quickly
    - Less popular stores get no visibility
    - Leads to unfair exposure distribution
    - Results in more food waste at low-rated stores

    Time Complexity: O(n log n) for sorting
    Technique: Greedy

    Args:
        stores_df (DataFrame): Store data with 'store_id' and 'average_overall_rating'
        n (int): Number of stores to display
        current_bags (dict): {store_id: remaining_bags}

    Returns:
        list: Top n store IDs by rating that have bags available
    """
    # Filter to stores with available bags
    available_ids = [sid for sid, bags in current_bags.items() if bags > 0]
    available = stores_df[stores_df['store_id'].isin(available_ids)]

    # Sort by rating (descending) and take top n
    top_n = available.nlargest(n, 'average_overall_rating')
    return top_n['store_id'].tolist()


def inventory_aware(stores_df, n, current_bags):
    """
    IMPROVED ALGORITHM: Inventory-Aware Ranking

    Strategy: Balance rating with inventory level to reduce waste.
    Stores with more unsold bags get priority to reduce end-of-day waste.

    Scoring formula:
        score = 0.5 * (rating/5.0) + 0.5 * (bags/max_bags)

    Pros:
    - Reduces food waste by prioritizing stores with more inventory
    - Still considers quality (rating)
    - Better fairness than pure greedy

    Cons:
    - May show lower-rated stores
    - Fixed 50/50 weight ratio may not be optimal

    Time Complexity: O(n) for scoring + O(n log n) for sorting
    Technique: Greedy with weighted scoring

    Args:
        stores_df (DataFrame): Store data
        n (int): Number of stores to display
        current_bags (dict): {store_id: remaining_bags}

    Returns:
        list: Top n store IDs by combined score

        return []

        # Normalize inventory to 0-1 range
        inventory_score = current_bags[sid] / max_bags

        # Weighted combination: 50% rating + 50% inventory
        score = 0.5 * rating_score + 0.5 * inventory_score
        scores.append((sid, score))

    # Sort by score descending and return top n
